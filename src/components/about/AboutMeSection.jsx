      Hey there! I'm Prateek Singh Chouhan, a 20-year-old Full-Stack developer from Bhopal, India. 
      Currently, I'm in my final year pursuing a Computer Science Engineering degree. I
      thrive on crafting intuitive and dynamic UIs, especially with React.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4 text-[15px]">
      I began my tech journey at the end of 2022, and since then, I've developed a strong
      expertise in building responsive and secure web applications that offer a seamless
      user experience. Along with my love for animation and UI design, I find full-stack
      development incredibly fascinating.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4 text-[15px]">
      I'm especially intrigued by creating scalable backends and robust applications,
      which adds another layer of excitement to my work.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4 text-[15px]">
      Lately, I'm exploring backend technologies like Node.js and GraphQL, with a
      growing curiosity for Web3 on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4 text-[15px]">
      Off-screen, I'm all about balance: hitting the gym, playing football, swimming, 
      and diving into video games. These activities keep me energized and sharp for 
      tackling the latest web development challenges.
